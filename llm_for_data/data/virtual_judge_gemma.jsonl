By allowing functions to modify the context string, you can create templates that adapt to different contexts without needing to rewrite the template itself. This leads to increased reusability and maintainability of your templates.\n\nSecondly, function mappings like `format_context_fn` facilitate dynamic few-shot prompting.

This results in more concise and readable code while maintaining the flexibility to handle diverse input scenarios.\n\nOverall, incorporating function mappings like `format_context_fn` into PromptTemplates elevates them from simple string replacement mechanisms to powerful tools for crafting tailored prompting experiences.

A stateful system would work similarly, allowing for more informed and relevant responses by drawing from its memory of past interactions.\n\nThis is particularly useful when dealing with complex or nuanced topics, as it enables the system to provide more cohesive and accurate answers over time, rather than treating each new input in isolation."}
